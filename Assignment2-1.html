			<h2>Story 1: <a href="http://www.scp-wiki.net//laughter" target="_blank">SCP-1268 Laughter</a></h2>
			<p>Most days, I wish I hadn't been given the ability to do anything for myself. It's nice that I can feed myself and use the toilet on my own, for what I hope are obvious reasons. The act of operating an elevator properly is the high point of my day - the moment where I can choose the floor I want is like having a weight lifted off of my chest. And so on and so forth.</p>
			<p>The thing about agency is that even the smallest drop opens the door for guilt. There are an assortment of very good reasons why I'm not responsible for what I do, but whenever I do anything more than put one foot in front of the other, I can't shake away the thought: <i>You could have stopped yourself</i>. Guilt is the one emotion I've always felt strongly, and it's doing me no favors now.</p>
			<p>Every so often, I'll try to count the bodies - memorializing them, if only in aggregate - but my body is usually steering me away before I can get a look at everyone. It's a shame, because I'm very good at memorization (always have been, actually) and could keep an accurate tally if I was allowed. Now, <i>that</i> has done me favors - my memory is what allows me to "write" this. Writing still brings satisfaction even when I'm the whole audience.</p>
			<p>But I digress. My point is, I am a writer, and with some effort I can still do it in a limited fashion. I construct narratives. Here are two narratives.</p>
			<p>The first entails me being placed into a body that goes around and makes people kill each other in a blind panic. I am a decent person, and I find this very tragic, and I wish that it wasn't happening, or at the very least that I was not forced to participate. Even the faintest whiff of agency is enough to make me doubt and blame myself. It happens anyways.</p>
			<p>The second entails me being placed into a body that goes around and makes people kill each other in a blind panic. I am an evil man who takes great joy in this, only wishing that I could take control of my body and do it more often. Every moment where I can move for myself gives me hope that this might happen. Things proceed as normal.</p>
			<p>You'll notice that empathy and decency only cause me anguish; I doubt they alleviate the pain of being crushed under a pile of screaming humanity. My teachers always said that a logical, detached perspective was one of my strengths.</p>
			<p>There's a moment, when the crowd's fervor reaches its fever pitch, where I have a chance to express myself. Not speech, unfortunately. But whatever I'm feeling comes out, if I let it.</p>
			<p>I'm tired of crying. Maybe I should laugh."</p>

			<p>I'm sinking.</p>
			<p>And sinking.</p>

			<p>And sinking.</p>

			<p>And…</p>
			<p>…</p>
			<p>…</p>
			<p>…</p>
			<p>—the hell am I?</p>
			<p>
				I yell: "<span class="blank">Hello?</span>"<br>
				<span class="blank">huh?</span><br>
				Nothing. Not even the sound of my voice. At least, I don't think—<br>
				<span class="blank">hello?</span><br>
				—wait. Did I hear something?<br>
				<span class="blank">is someone there?</span><br>
				No. Just endless white void, as far as my eyes can see. It's like an ocean — or maybe a desert. There's no texture, no sound, not even the steady thud of my own heart. I try to look at my hands — can't see them, can't even feel them. It's like they're not there. I try to close my eyes, but I still see white.<br>
				<span class="blank">please talk to me.</span><br>
				Am I dead?<br>
				<span class="blank">i'm so alone.</span><br>
				Think. I've got to think. I try coaxing up some memory, some thought of how I might have ended up in this miserable place. There was a room — right. A room, and an old woman, and her wheezing laughter, and then there was the grenade, and…<br>
				<span class="blank">i'm so scared.</span><br>
				…oh.<br>
				<span class="blank">please say something.</span><br>
				Right.<br>
				<span class="blank">i've been here so long.</span><br>
				Shit.<br>
				<span class="blank">i just want to hear a voice.</span><br>
				There was an explosion, and — without even thinking — I dove down through the veil to escape. As deep as I could. Deeper than I even knew was possible. And now, I'm…<br>
				<span class="blank">maybe you're scared too?</span><br>
				<i>Shit.</i><br>
				<span class="blank">don't be scared.</span><br>
				What the hell is this place? How many layers deep have I gone? I concentrate, focusing — searching for the invisible tether that connects me to my world. I wrap my consciousness around it — and start to pull.<br>
				<span class="blank">wait what are you — no.</span><br>
				I drag myself out of this endless ocean of white — inch by excruciating inch. I feel myself press against the boundaries of this place. I feel myself pushing <i>through</i> them…<br>
				<span class="blank">please, don't go.</span><br>
				…and then I feel something grab me.<br>
				<span class="blank"><i>YOU FUCKING WHORE HOW FUCKING DARE YOU</i></span><br>
				I can feel my limbs. My hands, my feet, my body — I still can't see them, but I can <i>sense</i> them. Something has me by my ankle. It's trying to pull me 'down' — deeper into the layers beneath this one. A level below whatever this… emptiness is.<br>
				<span class="blank"><i>THIS IS MY REALM HERE I AM GOD</i></span><br>
				I pull with everything I've got. It feels like an anchor tied to my foot — my muscles spasm as a sharp stabbing pain lances up through my calf and knee. It feels like whatever's pulling on me might take my whole foot with it.<br>
				<span class="blank"><i>I WILL RIP OUT YOUR FUCKING EYES</i></span><br>
				If it means getting the hell out of here, it can <i>have</i> my foot. Hell, it can have the whole damn leg. I rear my other boot up and slam down, feeling the heel collide with… something. Suddenly, my ankle slips free.<br>
				<span class="blank"><i>AAAUGH FUCK FUCK FUCK</i></span><br>
				I reel myself up, squeezing against the membrane, pressing through it —<br>
				<span class="blank"><i>please no please i'm so sorry i'll be good don't go —</i></span>
			</p>

			<hr>

			<p>— and into an apartment.</p>
			<p>Thick, plush brown carpet coats the floor. The walls are a hideous shade of peach-pink. The air is stale and old. I squeeze the pommel of my .45 and give the room a quick sweep, looking for anything out of place. Am I back? Is this Chicago? <i>My</i> Chicago?</p>
			<p>Everything looks ordinary: Table, desk, sunlight pouring in through a window. I take a step toward the light.</p>
			<p>Outside, I see a small corner diner; further in the distance, I see a hot-dog cart. I see sidewalks and lamp-posts, store-fronts and automobiles…</p>
			<p>…but not a single soul.</p>
			<p>When I take a step back, my boot sinks deep into that thick carpet. I look down. It's not <i>just</i> brown; there's streaks of black, gold — even an occasional wispy curl of copper-red. Something about it catches my eye. I crouch down to examine the fibers. They're fine — too fine. The material is…</p>
			<p>Hair.</p>
			<p>My eyes drift to that grotesquely pink wall. I start to notice the imperfections — blemishes, pock-marks, scars… beauty marks.</p>
			<p>Skin. It's made of goddamn skin.</p>
			<p>I close my eyes, grab hold of that tether, and climb as fast as I can. I feel myself slip through —</p>

			<hr>

			<p>— a world of rotting, putrid flesh filled with the deafening roar of billions upon billions of buzzing flies, gathered into blankets of writhing black so dense they blot out the sky —</p>
			<p>— an abandoned factory so immense that it contains all of Chicago, contains the entire sky, contains <i>the sun itself</i> —</p>
			<p>— Chicago, but choked with smoke and flame; the sound of gunfire rattling off in the distance, with every single door throughout the city flung open wide —</p>
			<p>— a sea of screaming faces, all squeezed together so tightly that they constantly burst into a bright pink-red pulp, only to reform an instant later —</p>
			<p>— and then —</p>

			<hr>

			<p>— I'm in what looks like a hospital room. There's only one door, and it's behind me; solid steel. It looks like the sort of thing you'd use to keep the monsters out.</p>
			<p>A wizened old woman stands in front of me, cloaked in dark fabric.</p>
			<p>Or maybe it's for keeping the monsters <i>in</i>.</p>
			<p>I point my .45 straight at her ugly mug. "Alright, lady. Talk." I'm trying to pull on my tether, but it's not working. I can't sense it — as if it's just been snipped.</p>
			<p>Her eyes brighten with amusement. Something snakes its way out from beneath her clothes — it looks like… hair. Dozens and dozens of strands of gray hair, writhing out past her feet and slowly extending across the floor.</p>
			<p>She clucks her tongue. "Really, now. You don't recognize me? After you went through so much trouble to find me."</p>
			<p>Iga Volodya. My eyes narrow. "Your face is different. Also? Pretty sure you're dead."</p>
			<p>"I have many faces. More than there are stars in the sky." She chortles to herself, then grins. Her teeth gleam like a platter full of steak-knives. "Today you have seen two. Perhaps — if you are very clever — you will see more."</p>
			<p>Alarms shriek around us. The room is flooded with a bright, flashing red light.</p>
			<p>"But enough reminiscing. I did not pull you here to chatter. We have business to attend to, you and I. Follow me — I will show you the way back to your precious city, <i>Yashenka</i>."</p>
			<p>She turns, and we —</p>

			<hr>

			<p>— are back in Chicago. The city is in a state of decay. Buildings have come crashing down; cars are flung over to their sides, torn asunder. The streets are covered in rubble.</p>
			<p>In the distance, I see the Roanoke Building. It's littered with dozens of human-sized holes, with the contents of each room dangling out like flapping tongues. I feel a dry, scorching wind blowing against my back. A strange force tugs at me — drawing me toward the source of that heat.</p>
			<p>Iga Volodya walks ahead, moving with a surreal calm.</p>
			<p>I look back. The sky is a horrible shade of tangerine; in the distance — far past the city — there is a bright, burning light. It is toward this light I feel myself being pulled.</p>
			<p>I turn to Iga. A newspaper brushes past my ankle; I catch the snippet of a headline before it blows away.</p>
			<p><span class="font">MYSTERIOUS FORCE DRAWS CORPSES TOWARD</span>—</p>
			<p>We keep walking. "What the hell is this?"</p>
			<p>"Have you ever thought about how many ways the world can end?"</p>
			<p>"Is that what this is? The end?"</p>
			<p>"It is <i>every</i> end." She looks back to me with that horrible grin. "And do you know why none of them have come to pass?"</p>
			<p>I open my mouth to reply, and —</p>

			<hr>

			<p>— we're standing in a kitchen. A family of four sits in front of us, preparing to enjoy a warm meal.</p>
			<p>But the family isn't right. They aren't people — not anymore. They're made of pink, pulsating flesh; heaps of it, piled into the vague semblance of human beings. Too many arms, too few legs. Bulging mounds of meat that throb with every heartbeat.</p>
			<p>The food is the same. Plates full of quivering tumors, spreading their tendrils out across the table. To my left, I think I see the family dog — just a mound of rolling, convulsing muscle. It extends a ribbon-like 'tongue' out to lick at a bowl filled with wriggling, squealing tissue.</p>
			<p>Iga Volodya surveys the scene beside me. She looks annoyed.</p>
			<p>"Your work?" I ask.</p>
			<p>"People always think so. But no — we did not do this."</p>
			<p>"'We'?"</p>
			<p>She looks to me. "Practitioners of Nälkä. The Children of Ion."</p>
			<p>"Sarkites."</p>
			<p>She nods. "Like yourself."</p>
			<p>I tighten my grip on the .45. "I ain't one of you."</p>
			<p>The flesh around us stirs. Although they have no eyes, the family seems to have noticed us. A deep, dark, hateful growl emerges from their bodies. I point my pistol at the biggest one.</p>
			<p>"But you are, Yashenka. You see it just as clearly as me. The corruption. The <i>wrongness</i>. And you fight it."</p>
			<p>With a horrible, gurgling roar, the family lunge to their feet. I squeeze the trigger, and —</p>

			<hr>

			<p>— I'm pointing my gun at a wall. We're back on the city streets. It's night-time; there are people here, running past us and yelling. I glance behind me — we're standing in front of the Chicago Theater. I can hear the sounds of screams coming from inside.</p>
			<p>"Again: Do you know why these ends do not come to pass?"</p>
			<p>A man in a suit leads a squad of police past us, charging for the theater's doors. They're packing serious heat — and their faces are all business. I turn to the city skyline. It's dark, but I can make out distant fires. The screams aren't just coming from inside the theater. I think I hear them everywhere. All around us.</p>
			<p>My eyes drift toward the theater's marquee:</p>
			<p><span class="font"> FOR ONE NIGHT ONLY — THE HANGED KING, LIVE ON RADIO </span></p>
			<p>"They do not come because they are ends. Because to end is to cease. And our suffering is not meant to cease. Our suffering is to be eternal."</p>
			<p>I turn back to her, lowering my pistol. "You done with the cryptograms, grandma?"</p>
			<p>She smiles, exposing those sharpened teeth. "And so we fight fire with fire; corruption with corruption. The universe is sick — and we seek to use that sickness <i>against</i> it."</p>
			<p>"Enough. Tell me who —"</p>

			<hr>

			<p>" — cut you open. Who's using you to harvest the worms — to help Weiss? Who's — ugh —"</p>
			<p>The ground beneath us is a spongy mishmash of colors churned together into a mush-like brown. The smell of sweetness is overpowering; it leaves me doubled over and choking. The earth gives underneath my weight. My left foot sinks down into the loamy soil with a horrible <i>schlrp</i>. A thick, white froth seeps up from around my ankle. That sickening sweet odor intensifies.</p>
			<p>Iga looks down at me.</p>
			<p>"Someone who perverts our beliefs. Someone you will find. Someone you will stop."</p>
			<p>"I don't —" The earth beneath me is slowly sucking me in. My ankles are gone; my calves are sinking. More of that cream gushes out, rising up past my knees. I try to push myself up, but my palms sink down. "I don't — work for you." My eyes focus on the landscape behind her. Rolling hills, plateaus, mountains of mush. I think I see a rock formation poking up somewhere — no, not rocks. That's the top of a steeple —</p>
			<p>"You do not work for me, but we are on the same side. The side of the angels. The side of <i>Ikunaan</i>."</p>
			<p>Down to my waist, now. I try to move my legs, but the mush just squishes out of the way — and I sink faster. "That's the side that eats babies, right? Just checking. I read your file. You're a goddamn monster." I'm about to drown in a sea of sugary mush and she's Baba Yaga. Pissing her off feels like the right move.</p>
			<p>She doesn't seem offended. Instead, she just smiles and reaches down to stroke my cheek with one of her gnarled, wrinkled fingers. "Oh, my dear, dear little Yashenka," she coos. "Of <i>course</i> I'm a monster. What else but a monster could ever hope to defy the stars themselves?"</p>
			<p>Down to my shoulders, now. Her cruel hand snaps up and seizes me by the hair, forcing my head back; I open my lips to say something — maybe just to yell — but she spits straight into my mouth. Something wet and awful hits the back of my throat. I feel it burning — everything is burning. I feel like I'm on fire. Her voice rumbles above me, crooning with a hateful, loving snarl.</p>
			<p>"Avenge me, Jacob Hartliss. Do it as a favor — from one monster to another."</p>
			<p>She whispers into my ear.</p>
			<p>The universe dissolves.</p>

			<hr>

			<p>The remains of a cramped little tenement room smolder around me. A wispy haze of smoke fills the space; the scent of burnt meat and burning wood is everywhere. The canisters have all shattered, spilling nauseous chemicals and glass shards across the floor. A fresh coat of charred Iga Volodya — with some scorched worm-meat thrown in — decorates the walls.</p>
			<p>Sirens wail in the distance.</p>
			<p>The wall behind me has all but disintegrated; I step over what's left of the door and into the hall. A family of four — ma, pa, two kids — stand at the other end of the hall, staring at me.</p>
			<p>I glance back at the ruin, then look to them. "What?"</p>
			<p>They rush back into their apartment, slamming the door behind them.</p>
			<p>I make my way down the stairs, out the door, and back into the bustling streets of Chicago. I take a good, long moment to savor the sights and smells of the Windy City — and then I go hunt down the nearest pay-phone.</p>
			<p>"So it's not Sarkites." September sounds annoyed.</p>
			<p>"I didn't say that." I rub at my neck. My voice is hoarse; I keep having to clear my throat. "Just saying it ain't Iga Volodya."</p>
			<p>"You're sure?"</p>
			<p>"About as sure as I am about anything. I got a name," I tell her, fishing in my pocket for another stick of gum.</p>
			<p>"You already had a name."</p>
			<p>"Well, now I got a better one." My fingers tremble a little as I struggle to unwrap the foil, jamming the stick into my mouth. "Wilhelm Reinhardt."</p>
			<p>"<i>Doctor</i> Reinhardt?"</p>
			<p>"Yeah. You know him?" I stop to chew and give a smile to the flat-foots running by. They're chasing the fire-truck on its way to Volodya's former residence.</p>
			<p>"He's a highly respected alienist and physician."</p>
			<p>Waitasec — physician. Didn't Weiss bring his personal physician with him to visit the stoolie who pulled that one-day Lazarus act? "He ever work for Weiss?"</p>
			<p>"He's a private physician. It's possible, but…" She sounds unconvinced.</p>
			<p>"Pull whatever you got on him — send it to my office. Also, I'm gonna need…" I take in a deep breath and steady myself. "I'm gonna need a favor, September. Need you to arrange a meet-and-greet for me."</p>
			<p>"With who?"</p>
			<p>"Richard Chappell."</p>
			<p>The line goes quiet for a little. I let her have that one — hell, I wouldn't know what to say either.</p>
			<p>"Are you… uh, are you sure?"</p>
			<p>"I don't like it, but yeah. I'm sure."</p>
			<p>"Alright. Uh…"</p>
			<p>"Call my office tomorrow with the details. I'll be in."</p>

			<h2>Story 3: <a href="http://www.scp-wiki.net//challenge-accepted" target="_blank">SCP-682 Challenge Accepted!</a></h2>
			<p>The sound of shrieking klaxons could be heard over the muffled shouts and dull thumps coming through the door. The interior of the chamber was still, the long rows of shelves filled with metal boxes and lockers remaining undisturbed by the chaos outside. The sound of thumps was getting louder however, as whatever was causing it grew nearer.</p>
			<p>Then one of the walls caved inwards.</p>
			<p>Through the dust and debris burst a large reptile, its head swinging left and right looking for any danger or people to eat. Finding nothing, it climbed over the pile of what was formerly a wall to check the room for any routes to the surface.</p>
			<p>The sound of gunfire from the other side of hole in the wall caused its head to snap upwards. It let out a deafening bellow as several bullets bit into its side. After the first few shots, its skin gained a metallic hue and the bullets began to ricochet off into the walls.</p>
			<p>"DISGUSTING FLESHBAGS, I SHALL FEAST UPON THE INNARDS OF YOUR REVOLTING SPAWN BEFORE SUCKING THE MARROW FROM YOUR BONES!"</p>
			<p>The reptile ran towards the opposite wall, knocking over shelves in its wake and sending their contents scattering. The wall ahead of it crumbled as it barreled through.</p>
			<p>A team of heavily armed men and women walked through the wall the reptile had entered from, advancing cautiously towards the other side of the room.</p>
			<p>"682 has entered Hallway B6-17, headed towards Research Labs, we are in pursuit. Prepare for ambush at intersection B6-17-103."</p>
			<p>The heavy boots of the squad crunched over broken masonry, glass and metal as they passed through to the other side of the room and the hole the beast had left through. After scouting the other side to ensure it wasn't lying in wait, the rest of the team left the room to pursue its quarry.</p>
			<p>The sound of roaring and gunshots became fainter again as the battle moved away. The dust in the chamber began to settle on the wreckage left in the wake of the carnage.</p>
			<p>The room was still.</p>
			<p>A quiet sound began, at first so faint it might not have even been there. If anyone had been there to hear it, they might have thought they heard a soft beeping coming from one of the safes that had been knocked to the floor. It was lying on its side, and one half of the door had been twisted from its hinges.</p>
			<p>"SELF-PRESERVATION MODE ACTIVATED. DO NOT DAMAGE ROBO-DUDE. DAMAGING ROBO-DUDE VOIDS THE DR. WONDERTAINMENT WARRANTY. ANY ATTEMPT TO OPERATE ROBO-DUDE OTHER THAN IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE PRODUCT INSTRUCTIONS, INCLUDING ANY ATTEMPT TO OPEN OR SERVICE ROBO-DUDE, IS LIKELY TO RESULT IN UNPREDICTABLE BEHAVIOR. DR. WONDERTAINMENT IS NOT LIABLE FOR ANY DAMAGE OR DESTRUCTION TO PERSONS OR PROPERTY RESULTING FROM IMPROPER HANDLING OF ROBO-DUDE. GREETINGS, ROBO-PAL."</p>
			<p>The remaining hinge on the safe began to sizzle until, sufficiently weakened by the acid that had been applied, the weight of the mangled door caused it to break free.</p>
			<p>A toy robot shuffled out of the safe and stood amid the wreckage, looking for what had caused it to be activated. Its boxy plastic shape had trouble moving over the plaster and metal shards, but it eventually managed to find a section of flat ground without too many obstructions.</p>
			<p>"ROBO-PAL?"</p>
			<p>Another shape began to stir amid the dust. The toy robot turned towards the sound.</p>
			<p>"GREETINGS ROBO-PAL. HOW DO YOU WANT TO HAVE ROBO-FUN WITH ROBO-DUDE TODAY?"</p>
			<p>"Who dares to call me robo-pal. I am the Crushmaster, doom to all I survey. Gaze upon my might and weep. Identify yourself, that I might know whose destruction I shall sow."</p>
			<p>The shape advanced through the cloud of dust until it resolved itself. It too, appeared to be a robot, but assembled haphazardly from a collection of items that didn't seem like they should even form a functioning machine. Its head was a broken upside-down voltmeter, its arms were wrenches sticking out of flashlight bodies, and its legs seemed to be made from a combination of springs, metal piping, and sporks.</p>
			<p>"I AM ROBO-DUDE, ROBO-PAL. I AM EQUIPPED WITH OVER THREE HUNDRED FUN ACCESSORIES TO MAXIMIZE PLAYTIME ENJOYMENT."</p>
			<p>The Crushmaster wobbled awkwardly over to the plastic toy, nearly tumbling over a few times, before stopping maybe a meter away. It stood a good four or five times taller than the diminutive Robo-Dude, and if anyone else had been watching, they might have thought that it tried to stand a little higher on its sporks than it had a moment ago.</p>
			<p>"I am Direfist the Bloodeater and I shall maximize my enjoyment by squashing you beneath my almighty boot. Prepare to face my wrath."</p>
			<p>Robo-Dude looked down at Direfist's sporks. It looked back up.</p>
			<p>"ROBO-DUDE SHALL ENGAGE IN ROBO-DANCE TO MAXIMIZE YOUR ROBO-FUN."</p>
			<p>Robo-Dude engaged its Robo-Dance.</p>
			<p>"Very well, puny weakling, I, Sparklord the Barbarian, shall defeat you at your Robo-Dancing to bring humiliations galore upon you and your ilk before I rend your soul into itty-bitty pieces."</p>
			<p>Sparklord began to gyrate precariously about its centre of mass, hopelessly out of tune with the tinny music emerging from a speaker somewhere on Robo-Dude's body.</p>
			<p>"ROBO-DUDE HAS RECOGNIZED A ROBO-DANCE CHALLENGE. CHALLENGE ACCEPTED. ACTIVATING ROBO-DANCE-OFF MODE."</p>
			<p>"Activate all that you wish, but your fate is sealed. The Kill-o-tron can not be defeated. I shall render you unto dust with my mad dancing skills."</p>
			<p>The two mechanical men began to dance in earnest. Robo-Dude accessed its optimum dance programming, performing to its maximum abilities. Kill-o-tron stumbled around the open space, falling over no less than seven times, and somehow managed to lose one of its wrenches.</p>
			<p>After about thirty minutes, the music stopped, and the two robots ceased dancing. Kill-o-tron managed to untangle the tines of its spork from a metal wire it had caught in.</p>
			<p>"ROBO-DANCE IS COMPLETE, ROBO-PAL."</p>
			<p>"Ha. Pathetic one, you have been schooled in the art of the dance by none other than Mechanobasher, Scourge of a Thousand Worlds. Kneel before me before I end your worthless existence."</p>
			<p>Mechanobasher, Scourge of a Thousand Worlds, raised its arms up in victory, its remaining wrench waving to an imaginary crowd.</p>
			<p>"ROBO-DUDE HAS USED ITS ROBO-DANCE-JUDGE PROGRAMMING TO DETERMINE A WINNER. THE WINNER IS ROBO-DUDE. CONGRATULATIONS ROBO-DUDE."</p>
			<p>"What insolence. Prepare to feel the sting of Doctor Von Vroom, Purveyor of Doom."</p>
			<p>Von Vroom began to advance on Robo-Dude, its sole wrench twirling menacingly in its socket.</p>
			<p>"ROBO-DUDE HAS DETECTED A SORE LOSER. ROBO-DUDE DEPLOYING HYDROGEN CANNON TO EDUCATE ROBO-PAL ON BEING A GOOD SPORT."</p>
			<p>The compartment on Robo-Dude's chest opened, and a jet of water shot out at Von Vroom. Von Vroom's sporks lost traction on the wet floor, and it fell over onto its back.</p>
			<p>"How dare you. Right me immediately so that you may taste your destruction at the hands of the Supreme Stabbinator."</p>
			<p>Robo-Dude watched as the Supreme Stabbinator flailed around on its back as managing to make small circles on the floor, but it was unable to lift itself off of the wet concrete.</p>
			<p>"I shall obliterate you atom by atom until not a trace that your worthless form even existed upon this wretched planet if I am not righted immediately, so says I, Deathkill the Destructionator, King of Kings and Lord of Lords."</p>
			<p>"DO NOT INTIMIDATE ROBO-DUDE."</p>

			<p>“So you’re saying that we can’t close 826 until…”</p>
			<p>“Until somebody finishes the main narrative, yes.”</p>
			<p>“And we still don’t know where the skip is… <i>hiding</i>, in the setting.”</p>
			<p>“That is also correct.”</p>
			<p>“What the hell happened? It never screwed up like this before.”</p>
			<p>“As far as we can tell, the interaction between the item, along with the book and matching <i>electronic media</i> caused the anomaly. We never tested 826 with multiple formats of matching subject matter.”</p>
			<p>“… God dammit. What now?”</p>
			<p>“I suggest we send an expeditionary force to retrieve the item. However, because of the nature of the setting, only one Agent may be sent at a time. We sent a three-man team in and they exploded.”</p>
			<p>“What.”</p>
			<p>“However, it has been found that we can retrieve inorganic items from the setting and keep them indefinitely within our world. While we do believe that they will degrade and vanish once the setting is closed, I believe that this gives us a… how does one say, cheat code, in winning back SCP-826.”</p>
			<p>“… what kinds of ‘inorganic items’?”</p>
			<p>“Please come with me. We have some preparations to make.”</p>

			<hr>

			<p>Dr Django Bridge had offered to house the Bookends at his Site for a while. While Site-66 is labelled as a Bio-Site, it usually houses miscellaneous animate SCP objects that may or may not be organic. Of course, he did this with the expectation that the other Doctors would <i>keep their stuff out of his stuff</i>. And of course, everything always cocks up.</p>
			<p>“I’m not an Agent. Why do I have to-”</p>
			<p>“You have proven in the past to be an expert when it comes to the current circumstances of the item.” said the ginger-headed research assistant.</p>
			<p>Bridge was being pulled down the hall by several Agents and Research Assistant Steve, towards the unused area of the Site.</p>
			<p>“That doesn’t even make sense. What did you do to my site?!” Bridge was irate.</p>
			<p>“Listen, I’m just reading from a script, my doc wants you to do it.” They turned a corner and reached a door to a testing chamber.</p>
			<p>“I don’t even know what you people are <i>doing</i>.”</p>
			<p>“Err sorry. Just take the instructions and backpack.” And with that, a large backpack was hefted into Bridge’s arms by an Agent, and the paper into his hands.</p>
			<p>“… Fine. Whatever. Okay. I’ll do your fucking mission.”</p>
			<p>As everyone else piled out, Bridge looked at the portal. A door of white light, opening to the unknown fuckup beyond. He took a deep breath, then a long sigh. Sure, he’s messed up here and there. The cockup with the lizard and ticket, yes, that was a bad move. Taking photographs of Birth Worm wearing funny hats? Yes, okay, that’s dumb. But what the HELL did he do to deserve this?</p>
			<p>Oh well. After several minutes of dread and reflection, he slung on the pack and stepped in.</p>

			<hr>

			<p>“So why is the guy who pulled the bullshit with the ticket going in to retrieve this skip?” Agent Dodridge leaned against a wall, watching monitors watching Bridge.</p>
			<p>“Eh, it can’t hurt. At best, everyone and everything comes back unharmed. At worst, he dies.” Agent Lament shrugged. He sat at the desk and got comfortable.</p>
			<p>“Yeah, but wouldn’t one of us do better? This guy’s a fucking… archivist? According to his file.”</p>
			<p>“Throw him a bone. He’ll appreciate it if he survives.”</p>

			<hr>

			<p>Bridge opened his eyes and looked around. A bedroom; a bed in one corner, computer… A TV and Super Nintendo sitting in the middle of the floor, that’s a bit strange. Shrug. Stairs in the corner of the bedroom. What…? Whatever.</p>
			<p>He descended the stairs, noticing a woman at a table. Okay. Seems non-hostile.</p>
			<p>“… hello?” He tapped the woman on the shoulder. She turned and smiled.</p>
			<p>“Right. All boys leave home someday. It said so on TV. Prof. Oak, next door, is looking for you.”</p>
			<p>He froze for a moment, staring at the woman, before running out the front door and looking around. A larger building to the left, empty fields to the right, a small fence before him, water beyond. He dropped the backpack and finally read the mission brief Steve gave him.</p>
			<div class="box2"><blockquote>Dr. Bridge. Enclosed is a set of mission-appropriate equipment, a photograph of SCP-826, and a packed lunch. Please retrieve SCP-826 as soon as humanly possible, and do not allow the complete destruction of any of the provided items. If our theories are correct, if you reach a “game over”, you will die.<br>- Agent Lament</blockquote></div>
			<p>Inside the bag were six red and white spheres, numbered 1 through 6.</p>
			<p>“… My mission is a Pokémon Red Nuzlocke with a hacked team. Fuck yes.” He turned and started off north, sticking a foot into knee-height grass.</p>
			<p>“Hey wait! Don’t go out!” He stopped. He turned to see an old man with a lab coat making his way towards him. “It’s unsafe!” “Go away-” “Wild Pokémon live in the tall grass! You need your own Pokémon for your protection.” “I really don-” “I know!” “Stop-” “Here, come with me!” “No dammit-”</p>
			<p>Oak dragged Bridge to his lab, next to a scowling kid. “Gramps! I’m fed up with waiting!” “Gary? Hm, let me think… Oh, that’s right, I told you to come! Just wait! Here, Django…”</p>
			<p>Bridge ignored the script, tapping his foot impatiently. As soon as Oak was done talking, he turned to leave.</p>
			<p>“Wait Django! Lets check out our Pokémon! Come on, I’ll take you on!”</p>
			<p>With a flash of light, a Charmander appeared before Bridge. He picked Ball #1 from his belt and -</p>
			<p>A flash of light; a flash of red; a huge, hulking thing appeared. A spine-sail down its back; its mouth filled with enormous, glowing, red teeth; sightless, eyeless face; unmoving mouth, laughing with many voices.</p>
			<p>“… Oh my god.”</p>

			<hr>

			<p>“… What the fuck.” Dodridge breathed flatly.</p>
			<p>“I think it’s the one we shot the lungs out of. In the game world it won’t kill Bridge. I think. ”</p>
			<p>“… Really? REALLY?”</p>

			<hr>

			<p>The thing laughed at Charmander, screaming in four distinct voices. Charmander shivered, then leapt and scratched it across the face.</p>

			<p>“Crunch!”</p>

			<p>“Well that was violent.” remarked Lament.</p>
			<p>“What do you fucking <i>expect</i>? What else has he got?!”</p>

			<hr>

			<p>Three hours later, Bridge was strolling through Cerulean City, into the Pokémon Center. Poking his head in every building, looking in every bookshelf, in every PC, there was no 826. He DID have the Boulder Badge though. Sherman took care of Brock.</p>
			<p>Entering the Gym, he tossed a ball into the pool. Three minutes later, he stepped out, Bob hopping behind. To the Nugget Bridge!</p>

			<hr>

			<p>“He’s enjoying this too much.”</p>
			<p>“Eh, let him have his fun.”</p>
			<p>“No look at him. These are war crimes. They <i>melted</i>.”</p>

			<hr>

			<p>Three more hours, and Bridge exited Celadon Gym, with Lazerbeak gliding close behind.</p>
			<p>“You’re kickass, Laze. How do you know Steel Wing? That’s not around till Gen 2.”</p>
			<p>“SCRAW!”</p>
			<p>“That is a horrible noise.”</p>

			<hr>

			<p>“Why do they listen to him?”</p>
			<p>“I dunno.”</p>
			<p>“No, that thing doesn’t even move until night. How’d you even acquire any of these? Zero Seventy Five is a high, <i>high</i> risk Keter. The fuck’s with these Doctors?”</p>
			<p>“I honestly have no idea. Wasn’t me who put the forms in. Steve rolled a bunch of dice and used the numbers to requisition for testing.”</p>
			<p>“… god damn it Steve.”</p>

			<hr>

			<p>Bridge exited Saffron Gym riding on Pazuzu’s shoulders. The dried up, shuddering corpse shivered and twitched, ignored by Bridge and the rest of the fucknormous spider beast.</p>
			<p>“Awesome job Pazuzu. You fucking <i>decapitated</i> ‘Zam with that last X-Scissor. I am in no way surprised that you’re Dark-Bug type, hell, I’m not even going to ask why your attacks are ahead of your time. Just keep kicking ass.”</p>
			<p>“Hhh-” coughed the corpse. “Sh-K!-ssss” shrieked the spider.</p>
			<p>They rode off to Route 19.</p>

			<hr>

			<p>“… Goddamn. It ate the fucking mime.” Dodridge sank into a seat.</p>
			<p>“MISTER, Mime, to be completely accurate.”</p>
			<p>“Shut up. Just shut up. I feel sick.”</p>

			<hr>

			<p>“… I wonder…” Bridge leaned on Cinnabar Island’s Pokémon Center’s counter, waiting for the healing machine to finish. Blaine’s Gym <del>is</del> was babies.</p>
			<p>“… fuckit.” He grabbed his balls and headed outside, calling on Lazerbeak to fly him to Viridian. Reaching the Pokémon Center, he headed north and saw a balding man laid out on the ground.</p>
			<p>“Ahh, I’ve had my coffee now and I feel great! Sure you can go through! Are you in a hurry?”</p>
			<p>“No.”</p>

			<p>Lazerbeak flew Bridge the fuck out of there and back to Cinnabar Island. He made his way to the shoreline, tossed Welker into the water, and climbed on its shoulders.</p>
			<p>They swam for a few minutes up and down the shoreline. Then… something appeared. Without warning, the skies darkened; a tall pillar of glitch code flourished into being in before Bridge and Welker.</p>

			<p>“Recontainment of Theta-Prime commencing.” Bridge muttered with a grin as he hopped into the shallows. Welker began singing nursery rhymes, teeth glowing redder; the glitchmon itself began to glow with a harsh light.</p>

			<hr>

			<p>“What the fuck was that.” Dodridge paled.</p>
			<p>“Don’t tell me you didn’t expect it.” Lament sighed, leaning an elbow on the desk.</p>
			<p>“… How… no. He’s fighting math. He <i>intimidated <b><u>math</u></b></i>.”
			<p>“I’m checking the Foundnet to see if anything breached containment. Just settle down and let me look for 106.”</p>

			<hr>

			<p>Two hours later, Bridge exited the Viridian Gym, Johnny in tow. The city burned, small cracks forming in the sky, Glitchmon leaking through. Old Man was nowhere to be seen.</p>
			<p>“Fuel.”</p>
			<p>“No.”</p>
			<p>“FUEL.”</p>

			<p>A Dewgong appeared with a flash and dove under the water. Bob followed suit, sinking through the docks. The water began to cloud; the docks began to creak. Soon, Dewgong floated to the surface and returned to its ball. Another flash of light, and a plop to the side as Cloyster clamped and dove in; soon, it returned to Lorelei in a red light.</p>
			<p>The docks started sinking. Lorelei’s Jynx fired silver Icebeams into the water and waves of telekinetic force battered the pool; neither Ice nor Psychic attacks could strike the irrationally agile snail. Soon the docks gave way under Jynx and it fell into the water. Another burst of red, then white, then red light, and Lorelei’s Lapras fell through the rest of the sinking docks.</p>
			<p>Bridge stretched and began walking, then running to the next door. In a last-second Indiana Jones maneuver, Bridge slid under the closing door to Bruno and returned Bob to its ball.</p>

			<p>“I've lived and trained with my Fighting Pokémon! And that will never change!” An Onix burst from the ground. Onix is Rock/Ground type.</p>

			<p>There was a silence after the Golbat returned to Agatha. Pazuzu circled the field, expertly maneuvering the gravestones, before just slumping into sleep. The Haunter appeared, and tried to bite the corpses’ head; it yelped in fright as the spider awoke and stabbed it into the wall, scrambling up into the dark. As the final Gengar appeared, Pazuzu dropped onto it, impaling the ghost with all eight legs.</p>
			<p>"You win! I see what the old duff sees in you now. I've nothing else to say. Run along now, child!"</p>

			<p>"Ah! I heard about you, DJANGO!”</p>
			<p>“Yes, yes, Lance the Dragon Trainer. Blah blah…” Bridge groaned. He looked around the penultimate room; huge statues of nondescript dragons adorned the walls, with brass torches hanging from the ceiling. As he took in the sight, an errant quote passed through his mind.</p>
			<div class="box1"><blockquote><font color=#824>…During this transformation process, SCP-826, along with the contained book, will relocate to another part of the book's setting, showing a preference for places where books are normally found (libraries, studies, etc)…</font></blockquote></div>
			<p>“Preference. Preference implies that this isn’t a hard and fast rule, just the prevailing behavioural trend that a creative object will show in a particular situation during testing.” Bridge murmured to himself; in a moment he caught a glimpse of silver-grey against the bronze walls behind Lance. The Bookends.</p>
			<p>“You know that dragons are mythical Pokémon! They’re hard to catch and raise, but their powers are superior! They’re virtually indestructible! Well, are you ready to lose? Your League challenge ends with me, DJANGO!”</p>
			<p>The battle began.</p>

			<p>The twin Dragonairs slithered out of the light, spitting blazing blue fire. Welker vanished, replaced by Pazuzu the horrid, twitching, choking corpse-spider-monster and Sherman the giant pile of sticks. Immediately, the marionette leapt out of the way and clung to the ceiling, and the Sherman cried out, shooting razor-sharp foliage in every direction. The Dragonairs, badly cut, slithered in unison, moving quicker and quicker into a pair of silvery blurs… until Pazuzu impaled both into the floor and Sherman ran them over like a runaway cyclone of conifers. In one last ditch effort, the serpents slammed their tails in unison against the spider and stack, before being diced and smashed to soup.</p>

			<p>A blazing, incredible blast of energy scoured the scene, cutting a trench across the floor - the snail didn’t even notice. Instead, it busied itself with… sweating. The Dragonite fell to one knee, taking a breath, exhausted by its effort… until it was messily decapitated by the snail launching itself like a cannonball across the field, its whole weight and caustic slime liquefying the dragon’s skull, Lance’s skull, and burning a hole through the door beyond.</p>

			<p>“Hey, don’t get angry. It’s not his fault Charizard’s not a real dragon.”</p>

			<p>Welker pried the final doors open, and Bridge stepped inside. This room was much bigger on the inside, opening to the night sky; an actual stadium, a coliseum, stood before him, with one single figure under the lights.</p>
			<p>"Hey! I was looking forward to seeing you, DJANGO! My rival should be strong to keep me sharp!”</p>
			<p>Quietly, Bridge considered what the fastest route to victory would be.</p>

			<p>The Charizard and 939 stared each other down, the dragon shuddering upon its remembrance of their first battle. Welker began to sing nursery rhymes as Charizard froze in brief terror.

			<p>On fire, the Welker leapt at the dragon, crunching down with a mouth full of lightning. Charizard returned with a slash, hewing a side of flesh right off Welker; the burning demon returned with a predatory bite to crush the skull. Charizard fell.</p>

			<h2>Story 5: <a href="http://www.scp-wiki.net//the-most-dangerous-game-of-all" target="_blank">SCP-085 The Most Dangerous Game of All</a></h2>
			<p><i>Drip</i></p>
			<p>He was lurking in the shadows of an old oak grove, gazing at the dark, brooding form of the facility on the hill above. She was there. Drop after drop fell on Feldspar's head, as he remembered the day of the betrayal. The day she came for them. The day they died.</p>
			<p><i>Drop</i></p>
			<p>It wasn't supposed to be like this. Feldspar remembered the first time he saw her, all those years ago. Just a frightened young woman, seeking protection from some very dangerous people. She never said how she located them, or what she did to earn the ire of the Double Blade Triad, but she knew his family had a solid reputation of dealing with folks like them, so she turned to them for help. His father, hard man though he was, never even thought about refusing, and they took her in.</p>
			<p><i>Drip</i></p>
			<p>She was the most beautiful thing he ever saw: slender, gracious, fragile, every feature of her glowing with an almost radiant whiteness. She was everything he and his family weren't, but she had nowhere else to go. Hidden beneath the wet leaves, he recalled the first few days they spent together, during that long, lost summer. She seemed so shy at first, seemingly folding into herself every time anyone tried to talk to her. He couldn't blame her, considering what she'd been through; though she tried very hard to hide them, Feldspar could see the cuts left on her arms where the Triad hurt her. He swore he would never let their blades touch her again.</p>
			<p><i>Drop</i></p>
			<p>They grow close during her stay with his family. She quickly opened up to them, and they in turned soften up to her. She became fast friends with his little sister, and they'd spend entire evenings sitting on the balcony, chatting about nothing much and giggling like little girls. His mother was very protective of her, never letting her help in the kitchen in fear she'd hurt herself. Even his father soon learned to respect her. And Feldspar, well, he was smitten from the very first moment he saw her, and getting to know her better only made it easier to love her. They used to go on long trips together, hiking down the winding dirt roads that surrounded his family's grounds. What a pair they must have seen to an outside observer- she fleet-footed and light, he heavy and ponderous. She seemed better now, after a few months in the company of good people, but he saw it was just an act. She was still hurting, still scared to the bottom of her soul from the day the Triad would come for her.</p>
			<p><i>Drip</i></p>
			<p>That day came, and much sooner than any of them expected. They were just coming back from one of their hikes, when, rounding the corner, he saw a flash of garish orange and dull steel, and they were upon him. There must have been at least a dozen of them, and their long blades flashed upon his body a hundred times within moments of their initial attacks. Their attack was fast, brutal and overwhelming, but they forgot one very important thing.</p>
			<p>Blades didn't do much against the likes of him.</p>
			<p>He broke them, every single one. Each pain they inflicted upon her he returned tenfold, and when he was done, so was the Double Blade Triad. He let a few of them get away, their long blades shattered, to send a message to the rest. They told him he didn't understand, that she wasn't what she appeared to be. He didn't listen.</p>
			<p><i>Drop</i></p>
			<p>Once the Triad was gone, they could finally be together. Those were the happiest days in Feldspar's life. He would return from a day in the field to find her waiting for him, her face covered in ink from one art project or another. He would laugh and wipe it away, and look into those big black eyes of hers, thinking how lucky he was. His family couldn't have been happier for them. Things were looking good. Things were looking great. Until that day.</p>
			<p><i>Drip</i></p>
			<p>Feldspar shivered as he recalled that final walk home. It was a day much like this one, grey and gloomy, and he was anxious to be home. He was covered in mud, tired, wet, and in desperate need of a good wash, and so he returned an hour early. He noticed something wasn't right the moment he entered the house. The usual ambiance noises were replaced with a deathly quiet, and there was no sign of the residents. He couldn't imagine his family going out on a miserable day like this, so he went around the house, calling their names, getting increasingly worried with each empty room. The house was empty. Lost for thought, he went on to check the only place left- the garden shed.</p>
			<p><i>Drop</i></p>
			<p>She was there, standing over the corpses of his family, looking down on her grisly work. His sister, who was her best friend, looked like she was strangled in her sleep. His mother, who cared for her like one of her own, must have been ambushed and strangled from behind, from the expression now forever frozen on her face. His father, who let down his guard to make her feel at home, seemed to have put out a fight- her skin, still white as snow, was carrying the marks of his last desperate struggle. It wasn't enough. Finally noticing him, she gave him a smile like a razor blade. "How was your day, honey?"</p>
			<p>"Why?" Was all he could say.</p>
			<p>"Why?" she said, slowly advancing on him, "Because you never saw it coming, because it was easy, because you let me. Because I could."</p>
			<p>"We saved you! We looked after you! How could you do this to them!? They loved you! I loved you!"</p>
			<p>For a moment, something like the a shadow of regret flashed on her face. It was gone just as fast. "Well. Bad call, I guess. Goodbye."</p>
			<p>She moved faster than he could have thought possible, and he gasped in horror as her skin began to extend, covering him, suffocating him, drowning him in pure whiteness. He struggled, but his heavy form was ill suited for such a fight. The last thing heard before he collapsed was "Oh, and thank you for dealing with the Double Blades, baby. They were the only ones who could stop me. Now, I can finally move on to the big leagues."</p>
			<p><i>Drip</i></p>
			<p>Feldspar had no idea why she let him live. Perhaps she still loved him, somewhere deep inside. Perhaps she just wanted to see him suffer. Feldspar didn't care. He didn't care that he didn't know where she was, or that she was much smarter and faster and stronger than him. He would find her, and he would kill her, no matter where she went.</p>
			<p><i>Drop</i></p>
			<p>And now he was here. Tracking her down to this facility wasn't easy, but luckily for him, he had several associates in critical positions inside. He wasn't sure what she wanted to do there, or how she made it in, considering how clever the men in charge of the facility were supposed to be. Most likely she used their intelligence against them, made them think she was theirs to control, that they were the one who created her. It seemed like her style, and she had done it before. He wondered what she called herself now.</p>
			<p>He heard that they called her SCP-085. Cassy. That papery bitch was so close he could almost touch her, and she had nowhere to run now. There was only one issue left to resolve.</p>
			<p><i>Drip</i></p>
			<p>How the hell was he going to roll up that hill?</p>
